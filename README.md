# Description: 
This Python script performs data analysis and visualization on two datasets: "world_statistics.xlsx" and "meditation.xlsx". It defines functions to load the data, analyze world data including meditation population across countries and over years, and analyze patient demographics including gender distribution, top cities with the most patients, and histograms of meditation levels. Additionally, it creates new visualizations of anxiety severity vs. depression severity and BMI vs. depression severity.
